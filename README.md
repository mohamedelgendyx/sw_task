# The task
The task will be a **project** and **AWS CloudFormation** template:

## [1] The project:
A project contains one page have a 2 categories checkboxes

### Example
- [ ] Category A
- [ ] Category B

If user select “Category B”
The system will create another 2 checkboxes with

- [ ] SUB Category B1

 And so on
